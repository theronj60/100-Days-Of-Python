# 100-Days-Of-Python

Documenting the journey of learning Python

## Project Grouping

For each project(day), a branch with the project name will be created and at the end of the day I hope to push that branch and merge with main. <br>
A push/merge indicates a finished project.

I will be going through Angela Yu's Udemy course, [Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
